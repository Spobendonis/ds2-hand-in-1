# ds2-hand-in-1
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a short project made by ITU students Adam Rose (adjr), and Giorgi Mchedlishvili (gimc), Tobias Spoorendonk (tosp) as the solution to one of the 6 mandatory assignments in the Course Distributed Systems, Dining Philosphers.
<h2>Running the Program</h2>
The program can be run by writing <b><i>'go run .\DiningPhilosophers.go'</i></b> in a command prompt open in the root directory (ds2-hand-in-1)
<h2>Expected Output</h2>
The expected outcome should be a single line stating the start of the simulation, followed by constant output in the terminal for 10 seconds, where each line should look similar to <b><i>'Philosopher x is eating/thinking y times'</i></b>, terminating with a line stating that the program has terminated. If at some point in the program a fork has been picked up by 2 philosophers at the same time, an error message will be printed and the program will be terminated.
